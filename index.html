      <h1>MSSW Guru's Gallery</h1><br>
      <h5><em>
          "Disciples pranams to everliving gurus who chiseled us."
        </em></h5>
      <p>
        It's the momentous occasion of the Platinum Jubilee (1952-2022) of MSSW, and as a part of the celebrations, we
        are honoring our dear departed Gurus today (5.8.2022) through this 'Gurus' Gallery'.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a long pending dream of our senior alumni - to offer a devout tribute to the past
        luminaries who lit our path with their insights, acted at a sounding board to our frustrations, and
        sacrificed their time and energy selflessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Guru's image in this Gallery is etched in our hearts and minds, and their words spoken to us continue to
        inspire and guide us even though they're no longer with us. Indian tradition places a Guru one step above God...
        our Gurus of MSSW had 'parented' us with wisdom and professional knowledge and shaped our minds daily. We will
        remember and honor them with our continued pranams to our gurus in this place of worship.

            <br>
            <h4>Early life: </h4>
            <p>
              was born on June 10th 1908 to Rustom Patel and Allamai (Khareghat) in Ootacamund. A very intelligent
              student, she also took the Trinity College piano exams. She also took an active part in Guiding and the
              Red Cross. At the age of 18, she married Nogi, the son of businessman-philanthropist Phiroj M. Clubwala of
              Madras. The couple had a son, Khushro (Phil), in 1930. Unfortunately, Nogi Clubwala died suddenly in
              1935due to ill-health. Adversity often brings out the best in many of us. Instead of retiring into a
              shell, Mary decided to occupy her time meaningfully.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1923, the Guild of Service was started by Mrs. Waller with a group of women to do social service. She
              joined it in 1935 and soon became its livewire. That same year, Mary was appointed Honorary Presidency
              Magistrate and she held a record for continuous sitting in the Juvenile Court. It was through her
              persistent efforts that Lady Magistrates were appointed to preside over the Juvenile Courts and, almost
              entirely, manage them. She also helped found the Juvenile Guidance Bureau.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1942, with World War II raging, Mrs. Clubwala founded the Indian Hospitality Committee with helpers
              drawn mostly from the Guild of Service. A large number of Indian troops were stationed in and around
              Madras and they had very few amenities. Mrs. Clubwala persuaded women from all communities and walks of
              life to join in the effort to organise mobile canteens, hospital visits, diversional therapy and
              entertainment programmes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The public donated generously to the War Fund started by the Hospitality Committee which continued its
              efforts after the War by helping ex-servicemen and their families rehabilitate themselves. The victorious
              14th Army presented Mary with a Japanese sword in appreciation of her tremendous efforts. Mrs. Clubwala
              was called “the Darling of the Army” by General Cariappa!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Activities: </h4>
            <p>
              As the War drew to a close, Mrs. Clubwala and Lady Nye, the wife of the Governor, threw open the doors of
              the Guild to men. After the War, Mary’s focus was once again on the Guild of Service which became a banyan
              tree which put down roots for various projects like health centres, bakery units, an adoption centre,
              family assistance schemes, Meals on Wheels, rural development projects, a school for the deaf, to name
              just a few.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mrs. Clubwala’s concern for destitute children was responsible for starting the Seva Samajam Boys’ Home
              and the Seva Samajam Girls’ Home in Adyar in 1950. These Homes gained an international reputation as model
              institutions. In 1954, she helped get started, through the joint efforts of the Guild and the Madras
              Rotary Club, the Bala Vihar in Kilpauk, a school for mentally challenged children.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps Mrs. Clubwala’s most significant contribution was establishing the Madras School of Social Work in
              1952. The School is the oldest in the country, after the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, and offers
              courses in Community Development, Medical and Psychiatric Social Work, Human Resources Development,
              International Studies, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1953, Mary married Major Chandrakanth K Jadhav, an officer of the Indian Army. He supported her in all
              her social service activities. These activities gained her international attention. In 1956, she was
              appointed the first Lady Sheriff of Madras at that time she was involved with over 150 social welfare
              organisations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Later life:</h4>
            <p>
              She was the first Indian woman voluntary social worker to be invited to the United States under the Leader
              Specialists’ Programme. She gave numerous lectures on social service activities in the U.S. In 1957, she
              was appointed the UN Correspondent in India for the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders.
            </p>
            <p>
              She valued truth and honesty and disliked flattery. She was humorous and entertained with her countless
              anecdotes. She was a confident extempore speaker. Though she was in close touch with high-ranking
              politicians and well-known personalities, she was totally apolitical and, for this, she was respected by
              all. Her favourite dish was the sundal of Annapurna Cafeteria (on Wallajah Road) and the lime rice and
              rasam of Mysore Café!
            </p>
            <p>
              The President of India conferred on her the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan. Before her
              death in 1975, she suffered the untimely loss of her son Phil. Today, the Phil and Mary Clubwala Jadhav
              Trust disburses aid to many worthy causes which were dear to Mary’s heart.

            <p>
              PTT is one of our first directors of MSSW. Prof ptt along with MCJ set up the initial processos of our
              DSSA and it has been seeded and grown and flourished. PTT served in MSSW in —---. After his career in
              mssw, he established USSW and ISSW. Thus ptt played an important role in establishing pioneering social
              work schools in india. Apart from these schools, prof ptt served in east africa ethiopia on an invitation
              by the european government for social work programs and projects. During his last years, he settled in bng
              indulged in various social work activities. Ptt is survived by 2 daughters and 1 son. Prof ptt is thus
              part of the genesis team of mssw under the leadership of mcj.

            <p>
              After his stint at MSSW, the family moved to Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) where he was invited to be Advisor to
              the Ministry of Community Development. Spent 3 years there from there it was Udaipur(Raj.). He was invited
              by a prominent local body to set up a School of Social Work. That's how the Udaipur School of Social Work
              of which he was the first Principal, came into being . We spent about 8- 9 yrs in Udaipur which at that
              time was literally a one- horse town-- not the tourist destination it is today. While in Udaipur, he along
              with my mother spent a year in England -- he went as a Visiting Professor to the University of
              Manchester-- and a couple of months in the US as visiting professor in the University of Tulsa.

              From Udaipur, it was Indore-- where again he set up the Indore School of Social Work and was the first
              Principal there from 1971 to his retirement in 1983 - 1984. While in Indore, he and my mother spent a year
              in Singapore where he had gone as visiting Professor to the University of Singapore( not sure if that was
              the name of the University.). All the institutions that he established (MSSW,USSW and ISSW) are all
              flourishing institutions now, and have been producing successful professionals every year. Post
              retirement, he, along with my mother and brother , relocated to Bangalore where he lived till his demise
              in April 2012.

              great detail-- however, he couldn't complete it ' cause, in the latter years of his life, his eyesight was

              of a father figure than a teacher to many. During his tenure as lecturer he joined Madras Law College to
              do Bachelor of Law in the evening college.

              compassionate with many of his clients. He used to appear in courts on behalf of them without charging any
              fees. He also used to help people by extending monetary assistance.

            <h4>About:</h4>
            <p>Prof.P.G.Ranganadhan, fondly called PGR by everyone, was a faculty and alumni of the Madras School of
              Social Work. As a faculty member, he gained the deep respect of peers and students for being an expert in
              social group work, a critical component for all social workers. He taught not only textually but also
              candidly answered practical and complicated questions posed by his students. His classes were very
              exciting, and students rarely missed attending them!
            </p>
            <p>One of his biggest strengths was he helped many students understand practically how to work successfully
              in a group environment, manage different personalities and egos, and communicate their ideas eloquently.
              His classroom examples ranged from political dimensions to family-oriented group work ideas. He made a
              significant impact by imparting the practical skills to excel in social group work by demonstrating in
              person and sharing essential knowledge with students.
            </p>
            <p>He held students’ attention with a contagious smile and provided great motivation, especially when they
              needed it the most. Prof.PGR had many other accolades; he traveled inside and outside India for seminars
              and foreign exchange programs and was associated with various NGOs for youth, the downtrodden, and the
              voiceless. He was also a commercial pilot and a certified train-the-trainer, who conducted pre-retirement
              training programs for company staff on how to handle retired life and thrive during that phase.
            </p>
            <p>Prof.PGR will be remembered for his mesmerizing vocals and mouth organ performances, as well as his
              interest in dramatics. We honor him with our memories and salute him for the key influence he continues to
              have over his students and anyone who had the good fortune to interact with him

            <h4>About:</h4>
            <p>Professor PKV was an alumnus of the Madras School of Social Work himself. He graduated from the
              institute, and immediately joined as a professor, became the principal, retired and was still associated
              with MSSW long after. MSSW was his one and only full-time workplace. He factually breathed and lived at
              MSSW. So much so, to his family members he is synonymous with this institution.
            </p>
            <p>He belongs to the 1963-65 batch of MSSW. After which he joined the institute and officially worked until
              2004. He was associated with many other reputed institutes like Stella Maris, Loyola, DG Vaishnav,
              ICMRIndian Council of Medical Research, to name a few. He was a regular contributor in the Indian Journal
              of Social Work, released by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences Some of his independent publications in
              the Indian Journal of Social Work which could still be available online are as follows:
            </p>
            <li>Admission criteria and internal assessment in a school of social work: An analysis- P.K.
              Visvesvaran-April 2000</li>
            <li>How a minority tribal group in Nepal has reacted to oppression - A book review essay-P.K.
              Visvesvaran-April 2001</li>
            <li>Exploitation of the poor, communal squabbles, and the emergence of organised labour in British India-
              P.K. Visvesvaran -October 2002</li>
            <br>
            <h4>Other Work:</h4>
            <p>
              Professor PKV was associated with many NGOs mostly unofficially and informally-There are too many to name.
              However, he was consistently associated with Bala Vihar in Kilpauk, where he trained the teachers of
              special children with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis etc. He used to go there week on week with an
              abundance of passion – and he literally lived his non-MSSW hours there aside from his own home. He also
              regularly contributed to the Journal of School Social Work during his retirement and post retirement days.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>PKV and the MSSW Library:</h4>
            <p>
              Professor PKV, as some of his students would say, literally knew each bookshelf and each book in the MSSW
              library. Many have quoted examples of how he would know exactly where a particular book or research work
              lay and would pick and give it precisely when it was needed. He also had his own paper cuttings on many
              topics related to his work at MSSW and many interesting topics in general(he was an avid collector of
              information – at home he would always be found cutting out important social work articles from newspapers
              and magazines-much to the chagrin of his family, who would never get an opportunity to read a complete
              newspaper ) This was long before google was born-so he was literally the equivalent of google for MSSW- it
              is interesting coincidence that both Google and Professor PKV share birthdays! (September 27th)
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>PKV and the MSSW Principal's Office:</h4>
            <p>
              PKV was the principal- in- charge and later the principal of MSSW for almost a decade. So he had to move
              out from his professors room on the top floors to the Principal’s desk on the ground floor. Legend has it
              that he asked to remove the Air Conditioner from his room. His room was always messy- as was his space at
              home-Always strewn with books, paper cuttings-This became part of his overall personality. Nevertheless,
              his room at work and home was always a welcoming space, where he would cheerfully welcome his students and
              sometimes go out of the way to help them with information or guidance/training or even plain counselling.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>PKV and his Students:</h4>
            <p>
              To Professor PKV, his students were his world. He was always patient and approachable-and everloving with
              his students. The students would never believe that Professor PKV was known for his temper at home- since
              he was an epitome of kindness to his students. Students were his lifeline, his “raison-d-etre”- and that
              kept him going through all odds. Even if the going was rough or he was sick, he would prepare and wake up
              the next day with full anticipation of meeting and teaching his students. As life would have it, he was
              surrounded mostly by his students from MSSW, through his last journey in the hospital and even upon his
              death. The student community of MSSW remains his first family!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Personally:</h4>
            <p>
              Professor PKV was a wordsmith. He had a keen passion to learn languages- He had learnt French and German
              in the very early stages of his life and was continuing to learn English all along his life. He was always
              reading, even on his deathbed, and he passed on the legacy and interest of reading and writing to everyone
              who knew him well. In the locality where he lived Professor PKV was popularly known as “Radio Mama ''
              since was always carrying a transistor listening particularly to Voice of America. This channel required
              some special tuning and he would keenly do it from his terrace- Those were the days long before
              International news channels came to our fingertips and radio was the only source of information. The habit
              continued all along his life. He lived a very simple life, hardly concerned about outward expressions of
              wealth or knowledge-For him- every work was internal.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Gratitude:</h4>
            <p>
              The family of Professor PK Visvesvaran is indebted to all his students from MSSW- for supporting him/ them
              during their darkest hours of his passing. The students right from the early batches lined up like Godsent
              warriors helping the family in every way-and until today continue to remain in touch with the family with
              so much affection and concern. On behalf of Professor PKV, the family remains in deepest gratitude to the
              MSSW community.

            <h4>About:</h4>
            <p>
              Dr. Hannah Mabel Sharma, fondly called ‘Queenie’, taught Medical Social Work at the Madras School of
              Social Work. Even though she was a part-time faculty, her many years of experience as an esteemed member
              of several organizations like the Public Health Association of India, Guild of Service, etc helped her
              share valuable and unique insights with her students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born in 1912 in Chennai, Dr.Sharma impressed her teachers and professors during her years of study with
              her sharp intellect and passion for medical science. She served as a professor in Preventive Medicine at
              the prestigious CMC Vellore from 1938-39 and then took charge of the Maternal and Child Health Services in
              New Delhi. Her work was so commendable that the Government of India sponsored her Master in Public Health
              at Harvard University in the USA. After a stellar career, she retired as the Director of Public Health in
              Tamil Nadu in 1970.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr.Sharma passed away on September 13th, 1987, and is survived by her daughter Ms.Sringara Nicklas who
              lives in the US now. She continues to be remembered with great affection by her students for shaping their
              perspectives on the field of medical social work.

            <h4>About:</h4>
            <p>
              Kanan Verma hailed from the beautiful region of Srinagar, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The 2nd born
              to Pritam Chand and Mohini Rao, she grew up amidst five siblings, loving parents, and a father who was a
              towering role model and progressive thinker.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before she dug her deep roots in professional social work, and earned an MSW from Nirmala Niketan, she had
              majored in music and was a keen sitar player (and treasured her two sitars).
            </p>
            <p>
              After a stay in Hongkong and Singapore, the Verma household moved to Madras, and as fate would have it,
              she started her long and dedicated journey at the Madras School of Social Work, first as a field work
              coordinator followed by joining the faculty. There she stayed until she retired, committing herself not
              only to educating new batches of trained social workers but to the overall wellness of her students. In
              this regard, she was professor, mentor, friend, confidante, all rolled into one.
            </p>
            <p>
              When her time at MSSW was done, she devoted her days and nights to supporting and investing in the
              well-being and future of low-income girls. Sankalp, the nonprofit she founded, and which currently
              operates under the auspices of the Indian Council of Child Welfare, continues her lifelong mission of
              building strong and bright futures for girls. She strongly believed that a girl child should be educated
              and that this would allow them to be independent and agents of social change. This belief transcended all
              others and shaped her as a parent and the values she instilled in her three children. As one of her
              sisters once noted, "Kanan was always interested in helping others and her choice of profession in the
              field of social work was perfect for her."
            </p>
            <p>
              Kanan Verma embodied a zest for life. She never shied away from adventures (even tried to learn how to
              ride a scooter), took to driving when few women took to the roads, travelled extensively, and balanced
              work with fun. She gracefully balanced her personal and professional life, and always stood out in a
              crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
              We feel really blessed to have shared her journey and are truly appreciative of the Madras School of
              Social Work alumni for acknowledging her contributions in the Gurus Gallery during the School's Platinum
              Jubilee Celebration. <br> Mohinder, Nomita, Nandita, and Nomeet Verma.

            <h4>About:</h4>
            <p>Professor Lalitha Ignatius: 13th July 1946 - 11th October 2016. She was born in Madras Presidency to
              Capt. Jason Ignatius and Mrs. Florence Ignatius. She was the only child of her parents. She completed her
              graduation in Sociology between the period 1963 to 1967 at Stella Maris College and her Post Graduation in
              Social Work between the period 1967 to 1969. Her dream was to be a teacher and the ambition chiseled her
              into a passionate teacher. A remarkable mention is of the Dissertation “The Evaluation of Primary Health
              Centres" which was done under her supervision by our Alumnus Dr.Palaniappan (Palan). Eventually, she had
              to fail in health despite which she got back to work at the earliest possible fitness and tried to carry
              on with her passion. It is a pride to have such enthusiastic teachers who have made us who we are today.
              We owe it to them with gratitude. <br>
              Prof. Ms. Lalitha Ignatius madam is one among the dear and near faculty of MSSW. She is one of the fondly
              liked faculty, not as a teacher and a student, but more as a friend. A great person to quickly come and
              understand you personally and try to help you. A great personality and is a great social work educator,
              especially in the field of casework practices.
              <br>
              She did her Social Work at Stella Maris College, Chennai, TN and she went to Baroda School of Social Work
              to teach and pursue her Ph.D. there. With their brief stint there later our professor Mr.K.N.George,
              brought her to MSSW to start her long outstanding career in the field of Social Work education.
              <br>
              She served a full term with MSSW for almost 3 decades and was very very successful in blossoming many
              social workers. Her social work especially social casework classes are very very interesting with
              practical examples and trying to tell about the innate interpersonal issues in casework settings.
              <br>
              Later, she did her M.Phil at MSSW. Her contribution to imparting social work education, especially for
              Medical and Psychiatric students and Family & Child welfare students setting is amazing.
              <br>
              Many of the lady field social workers are inspired by her teaching and took a very successful professional
              of being a lady social worker. Many of our Alumni are very fond of having a continued relationship with
              her even after leaving the college for their social work careers. She is one of the great lady
              contributors as a faculty among the several lady social work background faculty member who has been
              contributed from the Mary Clubwala Jadhav team.
              <br>
